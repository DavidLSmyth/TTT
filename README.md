# TTT
TicTacToeProject
This was an introduction to tkinter and object-oriented programming. The implementation is unneccesarily complex. 
Comments need to be added! Once the program is tidied up, it could work quite well. The next step would be to
combine this with the multi-thread chat program to create a networked TTT program.
